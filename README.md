# Meta Quest Huge Browser

## Overview
The Meta Quest Huge Browser is a fun and immersive project designed to bring a novel way of interacting with a web browser in virtual reality. Upon launching the app, users are presented with a massive browser window in front of them. The app leverages the Meta Quest's hand tracking capabilities, allowing users to navigate and interact with the browser in a unique manner. Users can control the app using only controllers, only hands, or one controller and one hand.

## Features
- **Immersive Browser Experience:** A huge browser window is placed right in front of the user, providing an immersive web browsing experience.
- **Hand Tracking and Custom Poses:** Utilize the Meta Quest's hand tracking technology to detect custom hand poses for interaction.
- **Rock Gesture for Climbing:** Make a rock gesture or use the grip button on the controller to grab onto the browser and climb hand by hand, navigating your way through the virtual space.
- **Point Gesture for Clicking:** Use a point gesture or the trigger button on the controller to click on elements within the browser, making web navigation intuitive and engaging.
