# VastView

## Overview
VastView is a fun and immersive project designed to bring a novel way of interacting with a web browser in virtual reality. Upon launching the app, users are presented with a massive browser window in front of them. The app leverages the Meta Quest's hand tracking capabilities, allowing users to navigate and interact with the browser in a unique manner. Users can control the app using only controllers, only hands, or one controller and one hand.

## Features
- **Immersive Browser Experience:** A huge browser window is placed right in front of the user, providing an immersive web browsing experience.
- **Hand Tracking and Custom Poses:** Utilize the Meta Quest's hand tracking technology to detect custom hand poses for interaction.
- **Rock Gesture for Climbing:** Make a rock gesture or use the grip button on the controller to grab onto the browser and climb hand by hand, navigating your way through the virtual space.
- **Point Gesture for Clicking:** Use a point gesture or the trigger button on the controller to click on elements within the browser, making web navigation intuitive and engaging.
- **Interactive Menu:** A menu in the left hand allows users to move, with options for gravity and fly mode. With gravity, you can climb to completely experience the feeling. The menu also includes options to refresh the page and go back to the previous page.
